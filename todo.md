* Implement custom colorscheme based on OneDark
  (it should be present locally)
* Create OneDark light version
* Configure Murphy colorscheme (super contrast one)
* Dont forget to add for all colorscheme config 
* Create colorscheme system, so it's easy to
  switch between them, and any highlighting and
  transparancy doesn't break.
